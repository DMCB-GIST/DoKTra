# Biomedical Relation Extractor
This software provides three types of biomedical relation extraction for input sentences.

Please download three DeBERTa-xsmall-based [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ODaYqT9ymEsH04WxsLPBN2Os63GQPaDu?usp=sharing), and place them in the same location as the ```python nrf_rel_predictor.py``` file.

You need to anonymize the portion of the input sentence corresponding to the target entity.

You can execute via ```python nrf_rel_predictor.py```.
